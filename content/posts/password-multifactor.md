## Use two-factor authentication

A great way to ensure your online accounts are secure is to utilize two-factor authentication (or “2FA”). Not all web-sites offer this, but you should always take advantage of it when it is. You have likely read something about it, but ignored it because you don’t know what it is or why it’s important, so let me describe how simple it is.

## What is “two-factor authentication”?

Essentially, _two things_ are required to log into protected accounts.  In security terms, it is something **you know** and something **you have** (the two "factors"). The ability for _someone else_ to have both at the same time is almost impossible.

For example, you must know your password and you must have something physical, such as a mobile phone that is capable of receiving an SMS code.  More sophisticated and better second factors include authenticator applications (sometimes provided by [password managers](../password-managers)) and biometrics on your phone/computer (i.e. fingerprint or facial recognition).

## Why is it more secure?

If a hacker knows your password (from the dark web or phished you for it) and they try to log into your 2FA protected bank account, it would prompt **you** for a second form of authentication not the hacker. If you get notification from your phone or e-mail address that contains a code, you can simply ignore/reject the request and the hacker would not be able to log in.

Additionally, you’ve been ultimately been informed that your password was compromised, so you should immediately change it.  It’s as simple as that.

Using two-factor authentication with [unique passwords](../password-123456) for every online account is the best way to keep your data and finances secure!
