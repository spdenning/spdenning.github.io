## Use a password manager

Obviously, remembering unique passwords for hundreds of online accounts becomes nearly impossible. Thus, you need a password manager to help you manage all of them.

Dedicated software companies, such as [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/), [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/), [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/), and others, specialize in keeping your passwords safe. Leaving this up to your browser isn’t the greatest choice and it may be a bit daunting to take the next step. However, you really can’t go wrong in choosing any one of them and I would recommend doing some research with the following in mind.

### Business model

If the company providing the software isn’t getting paid, they probably won’t exist for very long. Most have free versions with limited capabilities that you can use indefinitely or on a trial basis to get started.

### Features

Find what matters to you, such as multiple device support or ability to share passwords with others. Don’t be afraid to pay for the features you want.

### Active development

Use highly rated software that continues to evolve and respond to security threats. Technology and vulnerabilities are constantly changing. Don’t forget to keep your software updated!

## Recent News

Since I originally posted this, the well known [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) company was hacked.  Per various reports, the actual passwords were not leaked.  However, other sensitive information was, and this poses enough risk to avoid it to manage your passwords.
